Install opencv and tkinter in pycharm and run attendance.py and enjoy.
just make a folder named TrainingImageLabel.


Here we are working on Face recognition based Attendance Management System by using OpenCV(Python). One can mark their 
attendance by simply facing the camera.

How it works:

When we run attendence.py a window is opened and ask for Enter Id and Enter Name. After enter name and id then we have to 
click Take Images button. By clicking Take Images camera of running computer is opened and it start taking image sample 
of person.This Id and Name is stored in folder StudentDetails and file name is StudentDetails.csv. It takes 60 images 
as sample and store them in folder TrainingImage.After completion it notify that images saved. After taking image sample
we have to click Train Image button.Now it take few seconds to train machine for the images that are taken by clicking
Take Image button and creates a Trainner.yml file and store in TrainingImageLabel folder.Now all initial setups are done
By clicking Track Image button camera of running machine is opened again.
If face is recognised by system then Id and Name of person is shown on Image. Press "q" for quit this window.
After quitting it attendance of person will be stored in Attendance folder as csv file with name, id, date and time and
it is also available in window.
